Compiling?
~~~~~~~~~~
To compile the source:

1) git clone https://github.com/MadCamel/energymech.git
-- If you don't have git you can still download the source:
    wget http://github.com/MadCamel/energymech/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xvf master.tar.gz

2) cd energymech
-- Since you are reading  this file,  you have most likely already
   come to this point.

3) ./configure
-- This script will prompt you for features to include or exclude,
   going with the default is not a bad idea.
   If you want to cross compile export the prefix of your toolchain:
   export CROSS_COMPILE="armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-"

4) make clean install

If  all  went  well  you  should  now  have  an executable  called
``energymech''.

Setup?
~~~~~~

Read the  sample.conf  file to  get  an idea of  the  config  file
commands and then try to make your own.  A basic setup doesnt need
much  more than  NICK,  ALTNICK,  SET USERFILE,  JOIN  and  SERVER
entries, the rest is just tweaks of default values.

Quick steps:

1) cp sample.conf mech.conf

2) pico mech.conf
-- replace ''pico'' with your favourite text editor,  look through
   the file for sections to change,  you will have to remove lines
   in order to get the bot to work. Check the file completely!

3) make a userfile

   construct a temporary file (trick.conf) containing;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   set userfile whateveryouwanttonameit
   user + handle * *!*yourident@*.yourdomain.com 100 password
   save
   shutdown
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   then 'run'  this file with  './energymech -f trick.conf'.  this
   will create a userfile  with the name  you chose ('mech.passwd'
   is a good descriptive name which I usually use myself).

   re-use the filename  you selected in your  proper configuration
   file. and remember to 'rm -f mech.session' if you compiled your
   energymech with session support.

4) ./energymech

That should get you running. If you don't see your bot come on IRC
after a few minutes,  you should try running the bot in debug mode
to see what's going on with...

  ./energymech -d

If you get an 'Unknown option -d', you need to answer 'Y' to debug
support when running ./configure from the compiling section above.

More Help?
~~~~~~~~~~

Read the  website for  goodness sake!  Thats what  its there  for!

        #emech is not a help channel

If you HAVE to ask  a question in #emech  then make damn sure that
its not covered by the website  documentation and try to ask it in
a way so that  we dont have  to type half  a book just to tell you
the answer.

Do NOT ask to be guided in #emech.  We will under no circumstances
help you compile, configure or run a bot.

We absolutely hate people who come into the channel asking utterly
simple  questions like  `Why doesnt  my bot connect',  `Whats  the
command to add a user', etc.  If you manage to stay in the channel
after asking something like that its simply because we're too damn
lazy to kickban your ass.

We will NOT teach  you how to work with UNIX  shells or how to use
your mech, you have to learn that by yourself. Im noting this here
since it seems to be a common misconception that we would.

In short:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS. YOU ARE ENTIRELY ON YOUR OWN WHEN
IT COMES TO CONFIGURING AND USING IT.
